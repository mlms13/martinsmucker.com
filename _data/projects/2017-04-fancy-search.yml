  FancySearch is a [typeahead search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_search) component written in Haxe, targetting JavaScript/browsers.

    - The component manages an internal state using [Lies](https://github.com/fponticelli/lies) (conceptually similar to Redux)
    - It responds to streaming events from the UI
    - Suggestions are matched asynchronously

  The component can be used with the raw DOM, but it works best when rendering to virtual DOM targets. It has been used in production with [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) and [Doom](https://github.com/fponticelli/doom)
