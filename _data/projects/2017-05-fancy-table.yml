  Fancy Table provides a simple spreadsheet-like implementation for Haxe and JavaScript. It supports collapsing rows, nested rows, fixed header rows and columns, and cell editing.

    - Cell content is rendered lazily to improve performance
    - Content is removed from the DOM when scrolled out of view, to support gigantic tables of data
