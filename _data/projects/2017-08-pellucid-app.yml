  **Objective:** Make en e-commerce experience for customers wishing to purchase digital charts analyzing financial data.


    - The front-end is written in Haxe (compiling to JavaScript)
      - [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) is the UI framework
      - Users interact with chart options using [json-editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor)
      - We developed an in-house component for editing data ([FancyTable](https://github.com/mlms13/FancyTable))
    - Admin tooling uses [Doom](https://github.com/fponticelli/doom) and [Lies](https://github.com/fponticelli/lies) (similar to React/Redux)
    - The back-end manages products, user data, and much more
      - Routing uses [abe](https://github.com/abedev/abe), our custom, strongly typed layer over [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
      - PostgreSQL holds all of the data
